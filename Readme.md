## Somke Generation
Just some experiments while I am learning about smoke generation and simulating things. Demo: [pages/index.html](pages/index.html). Just move cursor on **Right canvas to see smoke effect**.

### Disclaimer
I am no expert in JS and this project uses modified version of following two projects:
* [pages/scripts/smoke.js](pages/scripts/smoke.js) from: [bijection/smoke.js](https://github.com/bijection/smoke.js/)
* [pages/scripts/processor.js](pages/scripts/processor.js) from: [processor.js](https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/blob/main/canvas/chroma-keying/processor.js)

**Huuuuuuuuuuge credit goes to original authors.**

### What to do?
1. Clone this.
2. Start a localhost server (on this dir) to avoid CORS Errors. I am using [server.py](server.py) taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/acdha/925e9ffc3d74ad59c3ea#file-simple_cors_server-py). 
3. Open http://localhost:8003/pages/index.html and see it for yourself.

### Next
1. Trying to replicate this in Python using Matplotlib. (It was very slow failed)
2. Try with PyGame!
